# Alisha - Portfolio Task

[My portfolio site] (https://alocasia28.github.io/Portfolio/)
##Project Requirements

### Content
This website includes a section with a profile picture and some words about me. After that, there is a projects section with different types of languages. You can click on any of those tiles to be re-directed to a more detailed projects page. There is a contact form that will send me an email once submitted and the footer includes links to my Github and LinkedIn to contact me. 
- [X] At least one profile picture
- [X] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [X] Functional Contact Form
- [X] "Projects" section
- [X] Links to external sites e.g Github/LinkedIn

### Technical 
The website comprises of a main page and a projects page. It is version controlled with Git(life-saver) and has been deployed to GitHub pages. To incorporate responsive design principles, the website has been created with a mobile first design and has 5 media queries on it which adjust the navigation bar, size of items, and the layout for the following breakpoints: <634px,635-768px, >769px, >1024px,and >1440px

- [X] At least 2 web pages
- [X] Version controlled with Git
- [X] Deployed on GitHub pages
- [X] Implements responsive design principles.
- [X] Uses semantic HTML

### Bonus (optional)
This is my favourite bit! I've added a hover effect to the nav bar links and the portfolio tiles to change the background color to pink. The contact form fields change to pink in a focused state. And finally, a little bit of JS helps with the inclusion of a hamburger menu for screen widths <634px
- [X] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [X] Include JS to add some dynamic elements to your site.
